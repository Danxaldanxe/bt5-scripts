Included is a set of scripts written for BackTrack 5r1,
though I'm sure they still work on BackTrack 5r2.

Below is each script's name and a short description:

fix-rtl8187.sh

    This script follows commands easily found on-line
    to get the RTL8187 Driver working (Alfa AWUS036H)

get-figlet.sh

    This script downloads the figlet ASCII Art text
    generator as well as the fonts from textfiles.com

get-tor.sh

    This script downloads and configures both Tor
    (The Onion Router) and Privoxy for proxying
    You may also want to "apt-get install torsocks"

get-wifite.sh

    This script opens an SVN repository in the
    /pentest/wireless/wifite directory, this is my
    favorite wireless pentesting script

start-armitage.sh

    This problem may have been resolved by now,
    but there used to be an issue with starting
    Armitage with MSF's postgresql backend and
    this script was designed to alleviate that
